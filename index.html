                <p>I go by "Mike" to most. I was born in upstate New York as the youngest of five children: one sister and three older
                    brothers. Although we are a bit geographically dispersed now, we are all still very close. I am an
                    identical twin. And to answer your questions: <em>"yes we do look alike"</em>, <em>"he is, by three minutes",</em>
                    and <em>"no we don't feel each other's pain... usually!."</em> Although I did confuse him with
                    myself once, but that is a story for another day.
                </p>

                <p>I was raised in Connecticut where I met my beautiful wife and moved to New Hampshire where we are
                    raising three wonderful kids. We have a small cockapoo named "Cassie" that chimes in at about 115
                    decibels when exicited... which is often. I am fortunate to say that even though it takes
                    hard work, I am blessed to be living the American dream. </p>

                <p>I have a degree in Computer Science from Central Connecticut State University back when the PC was
                    the big technology disrupter, people were trying to figure out what that relational database thing
                    was all about and knowing C/Unix was considered edgy. I programmed embedded systems for factory
                    automation equipment, and moved on to embedded financial calculators for insurance companies. I
                    work for Cigna Healthcare as an Enterprise Architect helping to create an omni-channel experience
                    for our customers. It's another way of saying we're building self service channels and keeping our
                    customer service agents from ever having ask a caller: "Would you read that [letter/email/sms/] to me?"</p>

                <p>When I have a few minute of spare time, if I'm not chauffering kids or taking care of the house, I
                    enjoy a variety of activities: glamping with family and friends (it used to be winter camping I
                    swear!), hiking, genealogy, video/board gaming and am the quartermaster for a local swim club
                    concession. I sometimes dabble in crafty hobbies such as mailling, ring making, electronics, and
                    am an enterprising scholar of history.</p>

                <p>I am currently refreshing my techncial skill set with the UNH Full Stack Development Bootcamp. My
                    main motivation is to "keep up with the cool kids" since we live in a fast paced ever
                    changing world. It is one leg of a three part technical strategy: full stack, serverless and
                    machine learning. </p>
